       Don't you know I'm no good for you?
       I've learned to lose you can't afford to
       Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
       But nothing ever stops you leaving
       Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own
       I could lie and say "I like it like that, like it like that"
       I could lie and say "I like it like that, like it like that"
       Don't you know too much already?
       I'll only hurt you if you let me
       Call me friend, but keep me closer
       And I'll call you when the party's over
       Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own
       I could lie and say "I like it like that, like it like that"
